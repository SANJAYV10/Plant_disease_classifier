# Plant_disease_classifier


Implemented a plant based disease classifier that classifies whether a given image of a potato leaf has Early blight or late blight disease. The dataset for the training is obtained from kaggle datasets. The classifier is a non-binary classifier implemented via CNN models. Tennsorflow is the backend used. The model performs 98% accuracy on the training dataset and 97% on the test data.
